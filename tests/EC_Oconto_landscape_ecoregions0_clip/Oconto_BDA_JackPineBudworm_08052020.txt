OutbreakPattern	CyclicNormal  << CyclicNormal or CyclicUniform
Mean			11  << Annual Time step
StDev			1
TimeSinceLastEpidemic	2  	<< years
TemporalType	variablepulse	<< pulse or variablepulse 
		<< Use variablepulse to allow variability in outbreak severity
		<< JANA ALBERS NOTED VARIATION IN DAMAGE BETWEEN OUTBREAKS
		<< ON AVERAGE, ABOUT EVERY THIRD OUTBREAK HAS APPROX 1/3 THE DAMAGE.

MinROS		0
MaxROS		3
		<<For the variable pulse outbreak type, the ROS value is randomly selected for each outbreak
		<< event from the range between MinROS+1 and MaxROS.  
                << background ROS (i.e., outbreak severity during nonoutbreak years) is defined as the MINROS
                << MINROS = 0 means that mortality only occurs during outbreak years  
		<< 1+1+0.33 = 2.33/3 = 	 0.78 (AVERAGE INTENSITY BASED ON JANA'S EXPERT OPINION)
		<< 1+0.66 = 1.66/2 = 0.83 (AVERAGE INTENSITY IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER USING 
                <<   THESE PARAMETERS - RIGHT BALLPARK)

>> Notes from discussion with Mike and Jana Albers
>>  -  0-20 year jack pine = minor host, 21-40 year jack pine =  secondary host, 41+ = primary host.
>>  -  Susceptibility class: 0-20 year jack pine should not be killed by defoliation (min age for Class 3 = 21 years)
>>  Mortality rates from Kuhlman et al. 1963 for moderate to heavy defoliation = 7.5% for 30 year, 35% for 40 year, and 43% for 60 year
>>  Assume a mean SRD BDP of 0.66 for moderate to severe defoliation.  Divide the above numbers by 0.66 to account for probability of site 
>> being affected.   

>> Anticipated behavior - jack pine longevity should be effectively limited in the western region to approximately half its >> assigned longevity by budworm disturbance.  Examine the age distributions of jack pine in east vs west (where east is defined by 
>> ecoregions above) to evaluate appropriate behavior.
