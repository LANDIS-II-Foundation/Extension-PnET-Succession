PropIntensityVar 	0.65	<<Defines the proportion of the event that has an intensity less than the intensity class defined solely by distance from the axis.  Each cell in the event will have a probability equal to this parameter value of having its intensity reduced by 0.20 (intensity ranges from 0 to 1).  A value of 0 for this parameter will result in intensities that exactly match the ratio of actual distance to the axis over the event width.  Any value greater than 0 for this parameter will introduce some heterogeneity in the intensity values.
